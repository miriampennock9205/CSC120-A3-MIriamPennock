Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
I worked with Ada Li and Nina Saunders.

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I did not attend TA/office hours this week. I had planned to go to TA hours on Monday night, and then I developed a migraine and couldn't look at screens. Luckily I didn't encounter any actual issues while coding this week, so I was only planning to go to TA or office hours for this part of the assignment, and because of my class schedule and other commitments in the past week, those were the only TA/office hours I would have been able to make. Sorry! I will go to office hours/TA hours in the future I swear.

- What are your initial impressions of Java?
I've done a lot of coding in Java in the past, like a lot. So I don't have any initial impressions of Java, but I am happy to be back in a language I'm comfortable and moderately familiar with.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
Python is more readable than Java is on a basic level, but I actually prefer reading Java code. That might just be because I know Java way better. In general, I think the conclusion that I can draw about programming is that people are most comfortable with what they are used to (that might be a general world observation actually) and that Java and Python could both be good beginner programming languages depending on who you are. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I actually had a weird amount of success with this project, which was moderately shocking because that isn't usually how coding goes, but I was pleasantly surprised. I think that when people do this assignment in the future planning out the code on paper ahead of time would be pretty helpful. This isn't a super complicated or convoluted program to create, but if you don't make a plan ahead of time it would make sense if it seemed very difficult or confusing while programming.
